## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us as soon as possible. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

-   **Email**: Send a detailed report to [help@ecdconnect.org.za](mailto:help@ecdconnect.org.za) with subject line prefixed with *OPENSOURCE VULNERABILITY: *
-   **Details to Include**:
    -   A description of the vulnerability.
    -   Steps to reproduce the issue.
    -   Any potential impact (e.g., data exposure, code execution).
    -   Suggested mitigation or fix, if applicable.
-   **Response Process**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and aim to provide a resolution timeline within 7 days.

### Disclosure Policy

-   We follow a 90-day responsible disclosure period. After 90 days, you may disclose the vulnerability publicly, but we encourage coordination with us for a joint disclosure.
-   We will credit you for the discovery unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Security-Related Configuration

-   **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date to avoid known vulnerabilities. We use Dependabot to monitor and update dependencies.  We're in the process of updating dependencies.
-   **Authentication**: Use strong authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth or API tokens, and avoid hardcoding credentials.
-   **Encryption**: All sensitive data should be encrypted in transit using HTTPS.

## Known Security Gaps & Future Enhancements

-   We're in the process of updating dependencies with known vulnerabilities as detected by Dependabot.

Thank you for helping keep our project secure!
