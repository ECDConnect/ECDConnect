# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of this project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation. We are committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or personal/political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

As maintainers, we are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior. Given that this project is not actively monitored, we encourage community members to uphold these standards in their interactions. We reserve the right to address any actions that violate this Code of Conduct if brought to our attention, though we do not actively monitor contributions.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces related to this project, including the GitHub repository, issue tracker, and any other communication channels associated with the project. It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

As this repository is not actively monitored, we do not have a formal process for enforcing this Code of Conduct. However, we encourage community members to report any abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior by opening an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) with a clear description of the incident. Please note that we may not respond to or act on such reports due to our limited engagement with this repository.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html.
